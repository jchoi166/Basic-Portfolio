    <div class="aboutMe">
        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I am a UCI graduate and aspiring front end developer with a passion for Art, Design, and anything else that's visually inspiring. If I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing video games, watching anime, or hanging out (eating) with friends. I love great people and great conversation, especially when new ideas are being shared, so I hope we can collaborate on something amazing in the future :]</p>

I was responsible for much of the front end work, utilizing Semantic UI and custom CSS to create the layout of the app including the about page.

                        <p>A standard accounting app that lets you keep track of expenses and revenue through journal entries and run monthly/quarterly/yearly reports. The app was made entirely with React and Material UI (React CSS Library)  with each person assigned to a different component. I was in charge of the “search journal entries” component where the user can search for journal entries using a journal ID or Approver/Preparer name. The search function has an autocomplete feature and the search results are displayed via cards for each journal entry. We used Axios to make AJAX calls and MongoDB as our database with Mongoose to write out our queries. </p>
